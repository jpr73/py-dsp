# py-dsp
Python (numpy, matplotlib) + Jupyter Notebook/Lab + DSP

The motivation is to learn Python for Digital Signal Processing (DSP) or any engineering data processing.  Reading book from Richard G. Lyons "Understanding Digital Signal Processing", Third Edition as a background.  Primarily use NumPy and Matpolotlib and Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab running on local machine.  Secondary motivation is to move from GNU Octave to Python.

## Jupyter instructions
```
# Start the Notebook
jupyter notebook
```
